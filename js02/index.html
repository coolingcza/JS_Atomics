  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>alert outputs to a pop-up and is limited to strings, console.log is not visible to the typical user and is not limited to string output. </p>
  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an alert() to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p></p>
  <h2>What's one way that alert() might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>Pop-ups usually are obnoxious...and they don't tell you much.</p>
  <h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
  <p>Nope. The console isn't usually visible in the browser, so they probably wouldn't see the output.</p>
  <h2>What's one way that console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
  <p>Seems like to would be mostly useful for debugging. More of a replacement for pry with Ruby than alert.</p>
  <h2>When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
  <p>It seemed like they were run after the first alert was closed but before the Goodbye alert popped up. Ran it again to be sure--they didn't appear until after the preceeding alert window was closed.</p>
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>Is the form re-submission warning Javascript or something else?  If something else, what?</p>
